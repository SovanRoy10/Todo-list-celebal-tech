# React todo app

This is a React-based To-Do List application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete.

1. **Add Todo** : Add new tasks with validation.
2. **Edit Todo** : Edit existing tasks.
3. **Delete Todo** : Delete tasks from the list.
4. **Toggle Complete** : Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
5. **Filter Tasks** : Filter tasks by their completion status (All, Completed, Incomplete).
6. **Sort Tasks** : Sort tasks in ascending or descending order.
7. **Local Storage Integration** : Persist tasks in local storage.
